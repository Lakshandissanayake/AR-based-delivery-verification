# Delivery Verification System

## Project Overview
The 3D Modeling–Based Delivery Verification System is a technology-driven solution designed to improve transparency, trust, and dispute handling in e-commerce and logistics. Unlike traditional delivery systems, this project focuses only on 3D modeling and computer vision.

The system generates a 3D model of an item from multiple images before delivery, allowing customers to visually verify the item condition before accepting the order. Once accepted, the system provides AI-based packaging suggestions to the warehouse. During delivery, the system performs damage and tamper detection by comparing package conditions. Finally, it generates a proof of delivery, enabling instant refunds in case of damage.

## Project Objectives
- Generate accurate 3D models from item images
- Allow customers to verify items before delivery
- Provide AI-based packaging suggestions to warehouses
- Detect damage or tampering during delivery
- Enable instant return and refund processing
- Generate proof of delivery for completed orders

## System Workflow
1. The customer places an order for the item through the system.
2. Item images are captured at the warehouse after the order is placed.
3. A 3D model of the item is generated using the captured images.
4. The generated 3D model is presented to the customer for inspection.
5. The customer reviews the 3D model and accepts the order.
6. After order acceptance, the warehouse requests an AI-based packaging suggestion.
7. The system provides suitable packaging recommendations based on the item’s 3D model.
8. The warehouse packs the item using the suggested packaging materials.
9. The packaged item is sent for delivery.
10. During delivery, the system performs damage and tamper detection.
11. If damage is detected, the item can be returned and a refund is processed instantly.
12. If no damage is detected, proof of delivery is generated and stored.
