# Delivery Verification System

## Project Overview
The 3D Modeling–Based Delivery Verification System is a technology-driven solution designed to improve transparency, trust, and dispute handling in e-commerce and logistics. Unlike traditional delivery systems, this project focuses only on 3D modeling and computer vision (no AR usage).

The system generates a 3D model of an item from multiple images before delivery, allowing customers to visually verify the item condition before accepting the order. Once accepted, the system provides AI-based packaging suggestions to the warehouse. During delivery, the system performs damage and tamper detection by comparing package conditions. Finally, it generates a proof of delivery, enabling instant refunds in case of damage.

## Project Objectives
- Generate accurate 3D models from item images
- Allow customers to verify items before delivery
- Provide AI-based packaging suggestions to warehouses
- Detect damage or tampering during delivery
- Enable instant return and refund processing
- Generate proof of delivery for completed orders
