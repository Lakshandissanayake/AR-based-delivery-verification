# Delivery Verification System

## Project Overview
The 3D Modeling–Based Delivery Verification System is a technology-driven solution designed to improve transparency, trust, and dispute handling in e-commerce and logistics. Unlike traditional delivery systems, this project focuses only on 3D modeling and computer vision.

The system generates a 3D model of an item from multiple images before delivery, allowing customers to visually verify the item condition before accepting the order. Once accepted, the system provides AI-based packaging suggestions to the warehouse. During delivery, the system performs damage and tamper detection by comparing package conditions. Finally, it generates a proof of delivery, enabling instant refunds in case of damage.

## Project Objectives
- Generate accurate 3D models from item images
- Allow customers to verify items before delivery
- Provide AI-based packaging suggestions to warehouses
- Detect damage or tampering during delivery
- Enable instant return and refund processing
- Generate proof of delivery for completed orders

  
## System Workflow
1. Item images are captured at the warehouse
2. A 3D model is generated from the images
3. The customer views the 3D model
4. The customer accepts the order
5. Packaging suggestions are sent to the warehouse
6. The item is packed and delivered
7. Delivery-time damage detection is performed
8. Refund or proof of delivery is generated
